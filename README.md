# Credit Risk Analysis

## Objective

Given that the volume of good loan applicants outnumber risky loans applicants we are tasked with building and evaluating several machine learning models to predict credit risk. In this project we will: 
 - Use the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms to oversample the data
 - Use the ClusterCentroids algorithm to undersample the data
 - Use SMOTEEN to both oversample and undersample the data
 - And last, use BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier to reduce bias
